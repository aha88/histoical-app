The waiting time was relatively short. There would be a lot of people on weekends and holidays because the annual pass was very cheap. Many people went there to play for a while. Life Waves is very interesting, and there is a Live Band to cheer, which is very exciting. Children and adults can have fun. The zoo is not big, but it is also very interesting, especially when you meet an old goat that can cough. Food in the park is expensive, so you can bring your own mineral water. There is a paid locker. It is completely fine for two people to use a small 25 horse. It is the size of a normal schoolbag. Girls are advised to bring a hair dryer. There is hot water for bathing, but I never found it every time I went. The locker next to Subway is usually convenient for storing clothes and changing clothes in the bathroom. It is worth a visit. The children want to go again after they have been there.",

You can directly take the e-ticket to the entrance to exchange for the ticket and enter smoothly. The night view of Kuala Lumpur is very beautiful, especially the bird's eye view from a different perspective; I arrived in the evening and was lucky not to catch the rain.",

When we arrived at the jetty for the sky mirror and the people were about to depart, the driver said we had to register, otherwise we could not depart.
